# Create_map_study_area

With this R-code it is possible to create a map of the study area, with sampling points, bathymetry isabaths, 
reference cities, more a smallest map with the location of the area in the world. 
This is the classical figure 1 of many scientific papers. 
Struggling to do a clean code and now that itâ€™s set, we sharing it as maybe could be useful for other people.
